title: statoverride issue in Debian-based clients
desc: Occasionally, apt/dpkg will complain about issues with statoverride.  This can be fixed by hand when it arises, but it shouldn't arise at all - needs to be fixed.

    This most likely occurs because it expects a daemon should be running, but it
    is not. This can be fixed in this instance by simply removing the contents of
    /var/lib/dpkg/statoverride. Simply leave an empy file in that location.
    However, that is only a temporary fix which has to be repeated - we need a
    permanent fix.
