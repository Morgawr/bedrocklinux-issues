title: move everything to /bedrock
desc: |-
  Bedrock requires a few items to be included in each client at places such as
  /opt/bedrock and /usr/local/brpath.  This has caused at least one (albeit
  minor) conflict with a client.  Instead, everything could be placed in a single
  directory - /bedrock.  This is significantly less likely to cause conflicts
  with other distros.  This could also make things conceptually simpler on
  end-users.
