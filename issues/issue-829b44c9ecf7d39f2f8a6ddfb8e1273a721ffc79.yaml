title: Script(s) to automate setting up a client
desc: |-
  We need some method of automating the process of adding a client.  There should
  be a single command when run, would set up a supported distro as a client.

    Some distros have commands to set them up in a directory.  Arch Linux's pacman,
    for example, can do this, as can Debian's debootstrap (which should work for
    many Debian-based distros as well, such as Ubuntu).  The 2.X branch of
    febootstrap can do this for Fedora as well.
    
    We could, in theory, have a script which downloads the dependencies for these
    commands from their respective distros, unpackages them (the core busybox could
    include rpm, dpkg, ar, tar, etc) into a temporary directory.  It would then run
    the commands to get the client and remove the temporary directory.  This could
    work from the core or just about any other distro.
    
    For other distros which do not support this, it may be possible to automate
    downloading their intaller's ISO, mounting it, and running the installation
    scripts straight from it (skipping the partitioning step).
