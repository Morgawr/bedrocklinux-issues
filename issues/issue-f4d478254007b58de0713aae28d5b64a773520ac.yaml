title: init script support possibilities from initrd
desc: |-
  One goal for a future release is to allow using sets of {kernel,modules,initrd}
  from clients.  To ensure this is a possibility, The init script should be
  altered to take into consideration work which was done by the initrd.  For
  example, it should not assume /proc is not mounted, as the initrd might have
  mounted it, if an initrd was used.
