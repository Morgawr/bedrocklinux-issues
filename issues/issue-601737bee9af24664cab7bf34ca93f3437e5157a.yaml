title: Website URLs should be simpler
desc: |-
  Currently many of the website's URLs are overly-verbose.  For example:
  
  http://bedrocklinux.org/faq.html#This%20sounds%20overly-ambitious.%20%20Do%20you%20really%20think%20you%20can%20pull%20this%20off?
  
  These should be significantly simplified.

  - URLs for links such as the FAQ have been shortened.  Sadly this also means old links are broken, but if that ends up being the case, best to do this sooner than later.
