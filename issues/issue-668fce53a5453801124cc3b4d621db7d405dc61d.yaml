title: "brsh: determine if called as login shell or not"
desc: |-
  Currently, the method brsh uses to detect if it is a login shell or not is somewhat hacky: it checks of if $TZ is set.  If it is not (yet) set, it didn't yet source /etc/profile, which means it is probably a login shell.
  
  If there is a proper way to do this, it would be preferable.
