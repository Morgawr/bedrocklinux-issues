title: package manager manager
desc: |-
  A package manager manager could make Bedrock Linux significantly more pleasant to use.
  
  Currently, managing packages in client distros requires chrooting to that clients and using the client's own package manager.  This means a non-unified user interface is required for each distro.  Sometimes apt-get, sometimes pacman, sometimes yum.  It would be nice if something was available to wrap around all of these programs, offering a unified interface.  For example:
  
  $ pmm install --client=arch firefox
  
  Would call pacman in an Arch Linux client and install firefox there.
  
  $ pmm install --client=any sage-mathematics
  
  Would install sage-mathematics in the first client it finds which has that package in its repos.
  
  $ pmm install --version=newest libreoffice
  
  Would look through all of the clients for which has the newest copy of libreoffice in its repos and install that one.
  
  $ pmm install --version=7.2 vim
  
  Would install vim in the first client that it finds which has version 7.2
  
  If it is possible to significantly improve speed by caching information, this could be a good idea, but it'd be nice if it also works without caching.  Moreover, it should be super-portable and run primarily from just busybo's utilities.
