title: support shutdown
desc: |-
  A number of commands talk to init to shutdown the system, such as poweroff,
  halt and shutdown.  These have to be init-specific, meanning clients versions
  of these commands will not function properly.  However, those from the core
  Bedrock busybox do work.  Thus, brc-wrapped version of halt and poweroff can be
  placed at the beginning of the PATH to ensure function versions of these
  commands are available from clients.  However, busybox does not provide
  shutdown.  If anyone has ideas for a way to get shutdown to work from any given
  client, we should implement it.

  - bosco will have a shutdown wrapper at the beginning of the PATH that warns users not to use "shutdown" and provide working alternatives.  This will suffice for now, but a better solution is desirable.
