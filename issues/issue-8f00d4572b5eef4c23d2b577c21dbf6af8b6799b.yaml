title: bri
desc: "As of Momo, many information gathering commands are attached to other commands in unintuitive ways.  For example, to get a list of clients, one runs \"brc -l\" - brc should not be in charge of this.  Instead, there should be a single command to go to which returns such miscellanous information about bedrock: \"bri\"."
