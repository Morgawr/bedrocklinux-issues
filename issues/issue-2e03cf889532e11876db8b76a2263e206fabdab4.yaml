title: share man pages across clients
desc: Most executables on a Bedrock Linux system can run most executables from any client in a reasonably transparent manner.  However, man pages are not so transparent.  It is a bit jarring when one can run, for example, "debootstrap" from *anywhere*, but "man debootstrap" doesn't work unless the user explicitly calls the proper man via brc.  It'd be nice if this was somehow made to work transparently as well.
