title: new brp
desc: brc performance was improved in {issue f602cc97d5682b7886c63d2b8432d4ba3cb77438}.  It now also supports being called as something else and running based no how it is called.  For example, if a symlink were to be made to it with a different name, it would try to run run the corresponding executable.  brp needs to be reworked create a bunch of symlinks pointing to brc rather than shell wrappers.
