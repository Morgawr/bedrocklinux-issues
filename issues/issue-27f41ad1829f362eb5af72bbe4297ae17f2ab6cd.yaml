title: shell-agnostic way to launch shell as login shell
desc: If brsh thinks it is being called as a login shell, it sources /etc/profile then runs the desired shell.  If there is a proper shell-agnostic way to call *any* shell as a login shell (to force the shell to source /etc/profile and the like itself), that would be preferable.
